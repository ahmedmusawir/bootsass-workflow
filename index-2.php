				If so, this can create fears and anxiety that leave you in a state of overwhelm when you begin to think about stepping out of your comfort zone. You become detached and are not fully present in your life. I was there too, going through the motions every day like a robot. I am able to assist you in recognizing the areas of your life that are overwhelming you and help you to create a plan to break through them.

		<h3>Do you feel stuck in the same habits that you wish to break? </h3>

				Repeating the same behaviors over and over is "insanity!" Is the negative self criticism in you mind saying,"you can't do this," or "you don't deserve this?" This is why you cannot break free of the chains that hold you back. I felt the same way. I had constant negative chatter in my mind that held me back from my goals for many years. Now I can help you recognize your repeating habits and behaviors that you do unconsciously each day and help you break that cycle.
